# 🏥 Mini Healthcare Support Web App

This is a concept-level web app built for NGOs to manage patient support and volunteer registrations with basic AI-powered automation.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
- Netlify (Deployment)

## 🧠 AI / Automation Idea
The app simulates AI behavior by:
- Generating a short summary of the user’s message
- Creating an automated response based on user role (Patient / Volunteer)

This helps NGOs quickly understand requests and respond efficiently.

## 🌍 NGO Use Case
NGOs often receive many support and volunteer messages. This app:
- Collects structured data
- Summarizes messages
- Prepares smart auto-replies

This reduces manual effort and speeds up response time.
